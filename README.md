# tecRacer CloudWatch Logs Scan Directory

## Description

This tool automatically scans specified directories and creates CloudWatch log streams for each file matching defined patterns. It is managed as a systemd service that ensures itâ€™s running continuously, restarting on failure, and starting during system boots.

## Installation

1. **Modify the config file according to your needs**

2. **Run the installation script with root privileges:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
3. **Restart CloudWatch Agent. The script should automatically start**
   ```bash
   sudo  systemctl restart amazon-cloudwatch-agent.service
   ```

4. **Verify that the service ran successfully and the CloudWatch Agent is back up:**
   ```bash
   systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent.service
   systemctl status cloudwatch-agent-scan-directory.service
   ```

5. **Verify the Config File was created**

   cat /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.d/directory_scan.json

## Usage

- The service runs once in the background whenever the CloudWatch Agent is started.
- Configuration parameters, such as directory paths and patterns, can be adjusted in the `config.json` file located in the installation directory (`/opt/tecRacer/cloudwatch-agent-scan-directory`).

## Uninstallation

1. **Navigate to the directory containing the uninstallation script:**
   ```bash
   cd <your-repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the uninstallation script with root privileges:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./uninstall.sh
   ```

4. **Verify that the service and files are removed:**
   - Check that the service is no longer listed in the systemd services.
   - Confirm the removal of the application directory and its contents.
