# tecRacer CloudWatch Logs Scan Directory

## Description

This tool automatically scans specified directories and creates CloudWatch log streams for each file matching defined patterns. It is managed as a systemd service that ensures itâ€™s running continuously, restarting on failure, and starting during system boots.
